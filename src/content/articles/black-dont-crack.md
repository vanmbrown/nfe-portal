# Black Don't Crack? The Truth About Sunscreen and Mature Melanated Skin

**--- NFE Beauty Editorial Team**
**By NFE Beauty**

## For years, many of us believed deeper skin tones didn't need sunscreen.

After all, Black don't crack, right?

It's a saying rooted in truth --- melanin is indeed protective. It
provides a natural SPF of about 13, shielding the skin from some
ultraviolet damage. But "some" is not "enough." While melanin slows
visible aging, it doesn't prevent the deeper effects of UV exposure ---
hyperpigmentation, collagen breakdown, and textural changes.

For mature melanated skin, sunscreen isn't optional. It's essential
self-preservation.

## The Silent Aging Force

Up to 90% of visible skin aging comes from the sun.

Those fine lines, patches of uneven tone, and the dry, crepey texture we
often attribute to "just aging" are often signs of cumulative UV damage.
These are precisely the challenges that NFE was designed to address ---
yet without daily protection, even the most efficacious elixirs can only
do half the work.

Sunscreen is not just protection. It's prevention --- the invisible
shield that allows your moisturizer, vitamin C, and retinol to perform
at their peak. Without it, melasma deepens, dark spots reappear, and the
skin's resilience quietly diminishes.

## A Layered Ritual of Care

At NFE, we believe in layered care --- a simple, holistic approach that
honors how skin truly thrives:

**Protect.** Begin each morning with broad-spectrum SPF.
**Treat.** Address specific concerns through dermatologist-guided care
when needed --- such as peels or retinoids.
**Nourish.** Restore, hydrate, and fortify daily with NFE Face and Body
Elixirs.

This three-step rhythm --- protect, treat, nourish --- is the foundation
of well-aging for mature, melanated skin.

## Why Melanated Skin Needs SPF

Melanin offers beautiful depth and resilience, but it also makes our
skin uniquely reactive. It scars differently, heals differently, and
hyperpigments more easily. Sun exposure is one of the biggest triggers
for melasma, dark spots, and uneven tone --- and even brief exposure can
undo months of progress.

And because mature skin tends to be naturally drier and thinner,
UV-induced inflammation hits harder. Sunscreen isn't vanity --- it's a
way to protect your skin's comfort, barrier, and brilliance.

## Modern Sunscreens for Deeper Tones

Forget the ghostly cast and sticky residue. Today's SPFs are refined,
hydrating, and melanin-friendly. They blend seamlessly, enhance
radiance, and sit beautifully under makeup or skincare.

### Our favorites:

-   **Hueguard Skin Tint SPF 50 Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum** --- A
    modern multitasker that evens tone, hydrates, and protects. Its
    lightweight tint enhances deeper complexions with no gray cast.
-   **Hueguard 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum SPF 30** --- A silky, non-greasy
    everyday formula that layers effortlessly over NFE Face Elixir.
-   **Colorescience Sunforgettable Flex SPF 50** --- A tone-adaptive
    mineral SPF that adjusts to your undertone for a soft, natural
    finish.

    perfect for sensitive skin or post-procedure care.

Each complements the NFE ritual --- never competing, always
collaborating.

## When Ritual Becomes Armor

Think of sunscreen as your morning armor. It's invisible, elegant, and
quietly powerful --- protecting your collagen, preserving your tone, and
ensuring your glow endures.

You don't need a dozen products; you need smart layers that work in
harmony.

**Protect with SPF.
Treat with intention.
Nourish daily with NFE.**

This is not anti-aging --- it's well-aging: honoring your skin's history
while protecting its future.
