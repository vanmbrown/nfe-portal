For years, many of us believed deeper skin tones did not need sunscreen.

After all, Black don't crack, right?

It's a saying rooted in truth. Melanin is protective. It provides a natural SPF of about 13, shielding the skin from some ultraviolet damage. But some is not enough. While melanin can slow visible aging, it does not prevent the deeper effects of UV exposure, including hyperpigmentation, collagen breakdown, and texture changes.

## The silent aging force

Up to 90% of visible skin aging comes from the sun.

Those fine lines, patches of uneven tone, and the dry, crepey texture we often attribute to "just aging" are often signs of cumulative UV damage. These are precisely the challenges that NFE was designed to address, yet without daily protection, even the most efficacious elixirs can only do half the work.

Sunscreen is not just protection. It's prevention. It's the invisible shield that allows your moisturizer, vitamin C, and retinoids to perform at their peak. Without it, melasma deepens, dark spots reappear, and the skin's resilience quietly diminishes.

## A layered ritual of care

At NFE, we believe in layered care. A simple, holistic approach that honors how skin truly thrives.

<Callout title="The NFE rhythm" variant="brand">

**Protect**: Begin each morning with broad-spectrum SPF.

**Treat**: Address specific concerns through dermatologist-guided care when needed, such as peels or retinoids.

**Nourish**: Restore, hydrate, and fortify daily with NFE Face and Body Elixirs.

</Callout>

This three-step rhythm, protect, treat, nourish, is the foundation of well-aging for mature, melanated skin.

## Why melanated skin needs SPF

Melanin offers beautiful depth and resilience, but it also makes our skin uniquely reactive. It scars differently, heals differently, and hyperpigments more easily. Sun exposure is one of the biggest triggers for melasma, dark spots, and uneven tone, and even brief exposure can undo months of progress.

And because mature skin tends to be naturally drier and thinner, UV-driven inflammation hits harder. Sunscreen isn't vanity. It's a way to protect your skin's comfort, barrier, and brilliance.

## Modern sunscreens for deeper tones

Forget the ghostly cast and sticky residue. Today's SPFs are refined, hydrating, and melanin-friendly. They blend seamlessly, enhance radiance, and sit beautifully under makeup or skincare.

## When ritual becomes armor

Think of sunscreen as your morning armor. It's invisible, elegant, and quietly powerful, protecting your collagen, preserving your tone, and ensuring your glow endures.

You don't need a dozen products. You need smart layers that work in harmony.
