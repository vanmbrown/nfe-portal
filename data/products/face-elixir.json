  "texture_scent_experience": "<h3>Texture</h3><p>A weightless, serum-oil hybrid that glides onto skin without heaviness or greasiness. The emulsion formula feels like a second skin — hydrating like a serum, nourishing like an oil, but never leaving a residue.</p><h3>Scent</h3><p>No fragrance or perfume is added. Any soft aroma arises naturally from the elixir's pure botanical actives — including trace amounts of Blue Tansy and Helichrysum essential oils, chosen for their skin-soothing and restorative properties rather than scent.</p><h3>Experience</h3><p>Each application feels like a quiet moment of renewal. The formula absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling supple, balanced, and ready for the next layer of care. The elixir's warm amber hue reflects the richness of its natural actives — no dyes or colorants. Over time, consistent use reveals smoother texture, improved barrier function, and a more even, luminous tone.</p>",
