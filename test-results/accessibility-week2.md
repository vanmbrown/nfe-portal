## Remaining Test Failures (Non-Critical)

While the axe-core tests pass for critical issues, some Playwright test expectations need updating due to:

1. **Strict mode violations** - Multiple elements with same text (e.g., headings + badges)
   - Not an accessibility issue, just test selector specificity
   - Recommendation: Update test selectors to be more specific

2. **Missing test IDs** - Interactive maps don't have data-testid attributes
   - Maps are placeholder components for Week 3
   - Will be addressed during Week 3 implementation

3. **Form label locators** - Newsletter form uses different ID structure
   - Form is accessible with proper label association
   - Test expectations need updating for actual implementation

## Conclusion

### Next Steps
1. Update Playwright test selectors for strict mode compliance (P3)
2. Add data-testid attributes to interactive maps during Week 3 implementation
3. Continue accessibility monitoring with each new feature
